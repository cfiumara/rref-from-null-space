# rref-from-null-space

Inspired by a challenge given in the Linear Algebra course at <a href="https://lem.ma/">Lemma</a>, this algorithm uses the vectors defining a given null space to produce a matrix in RREF that would have originally produced that given null space.

It is not elegant, efficient, or otherwise appealing, but it does its job well enough--for now.
